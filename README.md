# Predicting-Platelet-Drop-in-ICU-Elderly
Interpretable machine learning algorithms predict postoperative platelet reduction in elderly ICU patients

Code used in the paper is in the R code file.

The code for the web calculator is in the calculator file.
To use the web calculator, download the repository and load the "C50_model.rds " file using R software. This tool allows you to calculate the probability of thrombocytopenia in ICU patients by inputting the necessary clinical parameters. Load the "svmFit_model.rds " file using R software, allows you to calculate the severity of thrombocytopenia in ICU patients by inputting the necessary clinical parameters.
